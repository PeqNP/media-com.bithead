<p>I really appreciate your interest in @ your service!

<p><b>@ your service is currently in closed beta.</b>

<p>Oh no! What? I can't buy this right now?

<p>Not at all! Beta testers will get the service for free through the beta period. Possibly further than that as a huge "Thank you!" You will also get a special "beta" badge, eligible for free features, sneak peek to new features, etc.

<p>If you wish to be part of the beta program please provide the following information:
<form action="/account" method="post">
  <label for="fullname">Full name</label>
  <input type="text" id="fullname" name="fullname"><br><br>
  <label for="orgpath">Company domain (e.g. com.example)</label>
  <input type="text" id="orgpath" name="orgpath"><br><br>
  <label for="email">Email</label>
  <input type="text" id="email" name="email"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Become a beta member">
</form>

<p>This information is used only to create your account and use the app. I will never sell your information.
